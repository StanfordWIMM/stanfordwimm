# Goals of the Program

SWIMM's goal is to reduce the gender gap in the mathematical sciences through mentoring and community events. We also,
- encourage undergraduates to apply to fellowships and graduate school and assist them with the process;
- connect undergraduates with members of the mathematical community who have a personal investment in their success;
- share information about possible career paths, conferences, and events;
- provide, through the mentor-student relationship, information about mathematics and related fields to students;
- help undergraduates devise strategies for achieving their long term goals;
- empower graduate students through mentoring.

# Structure of the Program

Each fall, graduate mentors are matched with undergraduate students through our application process. Mentor-student pairs meet one-on-one about once a month. Each quarter during the academic year, small groups of mentor-student pairs meet for a SWIMM-sponsored meal. Program-wide dinners are also held once a quarter along with other community events.

Some participants choose not to be matched with a mentor or mentee but attend the program-wide events.

SWIMM is grateful for the administrative support from members of the Graduate Mathematics Outreach Organisation and the financial support of the [DIF program](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/diversity-innovation-funds) run by VPGE. We also thank the administrative staff of the Stanford Mathematics department for their continuing support, without whom SWIMM would have not taken off.
